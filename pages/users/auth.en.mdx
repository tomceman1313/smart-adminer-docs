# Roles and rights

Within this area, the access rights of individual roles are addressed.

The user has the opportunity to create his own roles and assign them rights at his discretion.
The **Admin** role is assigned all rights by default.

The table of rights is divided into columns according to the types of operations. These species are:

- Reading - it is possible to read stored content (e.g. the system allows the user to view an overview of articles)
- Creation - it is possible to create new content (e.g. the system allows the user to create a new article)
- Editing - it is possible to edit existing content (e.g. the system allows the user to edit an article)
- Removal - it is possible to remove available content (e.g. the system allows the user to remove an article)

## Change role rights

To change the right of a role, click on the check mark or cross icon.
If the green tick icon ‚òë is displayed, the relevant role has the right to perform the given operation. If the red ‚ùå icon is displayed, the role cannot perform the operation.

<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
  If the role is not prohibited from performing any operation within the given part of the content, this part of the system is completely hidden for it and is not displayed in the navigation menu.
