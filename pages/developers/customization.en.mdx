# Customization

SmartAdminer can be customized completely to your desires.




## CSS customization

For customizing look of the system you will need to change CSS files.

All global styles are defined in `/pages/index.css`

Component styles are located in the same folder as component itself. 
If the component is small or not reusable, it's very likely that source styles are in a shared file with other components styles.
Easiest way to locate CSS file you need to change is go to the jsx file of the component and find which files is imported.

## Non CSS admin panel changes

For customizing components and pages you can use available components or you can make your own.

Forms components are located in `/src/components/basic/` folder.

Larger reusable components are located in `/src/components/common/` folder.

## Localization versions

SmartAdminer supports these languages:

- English 
- Czech
