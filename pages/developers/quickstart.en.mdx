# Quickstart Guide

This quickstart guide is designed to get you up and running with a SmartAdminer Project in a few minutes.

## Requirements

- PHP
- Node.js 16+
- MySQL running on your machine
- access into the phpMyAdmin

<Steps>
### Clone the source repository

### Create database

Go to your phpMyAdmin and create a new database.
Then import database structure from file located in: `/api/database/config.sql`

After this step you have the database prepared. 

### Change backend Environment variables

Change `/api/.env` variables to correct values


### Change frontend Environment variables

Change `.env` variables to correct values

`REACT_APP_API_URL` - Defines on which base url is api running. 

If the API is available on `localhost:4300/api/...` then value of this variable will be `REACT_APP_API_URL=localhost:4300`

`REACT_APP_PUBLIC_PATH` - Defines where the public folder is located. 

Default value in `REACT_APP_PUBLIC_PATH="/admin"` because admin panel is available at `http://localhost or domain name/admin`

```bash
npm start
```
